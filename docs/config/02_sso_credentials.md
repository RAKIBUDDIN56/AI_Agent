Single Sign-On (SSO) Credentials

This section configures SSO credentials used by the application:

SSOClientId → Client ID issued by the identity provider.

SSOClientSecret → Secret used during authentication.

SSOAuthority → Authentication authority (e.g., Microsoft Azure Active Directory endpoint).

SSO can be enabled or disabled depending on business needs. The configuration supports Azure AD or any provider following OpenID Connect or OAuth2.0.
